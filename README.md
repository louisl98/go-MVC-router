MVC Web Application in Go

To download and install the packages in order to start the server, run the following commands:

~~~
go get github.com/louisl98/go-mvc
go run main.go
~~~

If you are on Go 1.5, you need to set GOVENDOREXPERIMENT to 1. If you are on Go 1.4 or earlier, the code will not work because it uses the vendor folder.
